With the rise in popularity of ecommerce, an increasing number of people are acquiring smart-home technology online. A firm that sells smart home technology has opted to implement a new Online Smart Home Ecommerce System. Our team has then produced a "OSHES" database software program to manage product sales, administration, and maintenance with the use of MySQL and MongoDB.

STEPS:
  1. Connect your SQL and MongoDB.
  2. Create database OSHES and create relation tables in mySQL workbench with InitialiseTable.sql file provided in the SQL folder.
  3. Populate Product Table with products 001-007 in mySQL workbench with SelectStatements.sql file provided in the SQL folder.
  4. Create Administrator account manually in mySQL workbench with SelectStatements.sql file provided in the SQL folder.
  5. Run OSHES.py file
  6. Login with Admin:
    a. Press initialise Button.
    b. Create Customer Account and start enjoying the OSHES!

  *SQL INSERT and SELECT statements were extracted
  *SQL functions and MongoDB search scripts are all integrated into OSHES.py
